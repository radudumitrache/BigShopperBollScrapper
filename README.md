# Importing the database schema to your local database in PyCharm:

- After setting up PostgreSQL on your computer, navigate to PyCharm and connect to your local database, which is typically named 'postgres' by default.
- Once connected to your local database, import the schema by right-clicking on the local database, selecting 'SQL Script,' and running the SQL script.
- This process will import all the database tables and data for you.
